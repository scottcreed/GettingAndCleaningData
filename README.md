# GettingAndCleaningData

This is the final project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The script file run_analysis.R contains all the logic to produce the initial tidy dataset:
- Download the zip file from the source to a Data directory (which is created if it does not exist)
- Extract the zip file to the Data Directory
- Reads the UCI HAR Dataset\features.txt file which provides names for the 561 columns in the observations
- Reads the UCI HAR Dataset\activity_lables.txt file which provides the ids and names for the activity labels
- For the Train dataset:
  - Reads the observation data from UCI HAR Dataset\train\x_train.txt and uses feature names for the column names
  - Reads and combines the activity id data from UCI HAR Dataset\train\y_train.txt
  - Reads and combines the subject id data from UCI HAR Dataset\train\subject_train.txt
- For the Test dataset:
  - Reads the observation data from UCI HAR Dataset\test\x_test.txt and users feature names for the column names
  - Reads and combines the activity id data from UCI HAR Dataset\test\y_test.txt
  - Reads and combines the subject id data from UCI HAR Dataset\test\subject_test.txt
- Combines the Train and Test datasets
- Selects only the measures that are mean or std measures
- Merges in the readable activity names corresponding to the activity ids in the dataset

The final tidy dataset is written to Data\GettingAndCleaningDataFinal.csv

The dataset is then processed to calculate the averages of the measures by activity and subject.
This dataset is written to Data\GettingAndCleaningDataAvgMeanAndStd.csv
