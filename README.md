# GettingAndCleaningData

This is the final project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course.

**codebook.md** contains detailed information about how the tidy datasets are produced.

**run_analysis.R** contains all the logic to produce the two tidy datasets:
- Data\GettingAndCleaningDataFinal.csv
- Data\GettingAndCleaningDataAvgMeanAndStd.txt

## GettingAndCleaningDataFinal.csv
This file is the tidy dataset containing all observations for mean and std measures for each activity and subject.

The final tidy dataset is written to **Data\GettingAndCleaningDataFinal.csv**

## GettingAndCleaningDataAvgMeandAndStd.txt
This dataset contains averages of all of the measures from the dataset above.  The averages are calculated
for each activity/subject combination. 

This dataset is then written to **Data\GettingAndCleaningDataAvgMeanAndStd.txt**
